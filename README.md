# üèÄ‚öΩ Sports Injury Prediction

## Overview  
This project investigates **injury prediction in football and basketball players** using machine learning models. The analysis integrates player workload, performance metrics, and injury history to **identify risk factors** and **evaluate model efficacy**.

## üîç Methodology  

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Examine workload distributions (minutes played, distance covered, intensity).  
- Visualize performance trends (scoring, assists, rebounds, passes) and correlate with injury events.  
- Detect seasonality and cumulative fatigue (back-to-back games, training load).  

### 2. Feature Engineering  
- Rolling averages, exponential weighted moving averages (EWMA), and workload ratios.  
- Injury history encoded as binary sequences or time-to-event intervals.  
- Contextual features: age, position, and training schedule.  

### 3. Modeling Approaches  
- **Classical ML:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM).  
- **Deep Learning:** LSTM/GRU networks for sequential workload & injury history.  
- **Survival Models:** Cox Proportional Hazards, DeepSurv for time-to-injury estimation.  

### 4. Evaluation  
- Binary classification metrics: **AUC-ROC, F1-score, Precision-Recall**.  
- **Calibration analysis** to validate probability estimates.  
- **Model interpretability:** feature importance & SHAP values to highlight key risk drivers.

## üéØ Goal  
By combining workload monitoring, performance statistics, and medical history with advanced ML models, this project aims to:  
- Detect early warning signals of injury risk.  
- Provide interpretable insights for **sports scientists, coaches, and medical staff**.  
- Contribute to **injury prevention and player performance optimization**.
